Follow the Gap Method for Autonomous Race Car

follow_the_gap_node which provides a reactive method to navigate at high speeds in cluttered environments using the "Follow The Gap" algorithm".

This roscpp node has been tested on the f110 racecar platform at [University of Pennsylvania's mLab](http://mlab-upenn.github.io/f110/). To test in a simulated environment, the racecar simulator can be cloned from [mLab's racecar_simulator repository](https://github.com/mlab-upenn/racecar_simulator) and run using the ros launch file provided.
