# als_ros

An Advanced Localization System [1] for Robot Operating System use (als_ros) is a localization package with 2D LiDAR. als_ros contains following functions;

- Robust localization based on sensor measurement class estimation [2],
- Reliability estimation based on Bayesian filtering with a simple classifier of localization correctness [3],
- Misalignment recognition using Markov random fields with fully connected latent variables [4],
- Quick re-localization based on fusion of pose tracking and global localization via the importance sampling [5].

These details can be seen at [Reliable Monte Carlo Localization for Mobile Robots (arXiv preprint)](https://arxiv.org/abs/2205.04769).

# How to install and use

## How to install

ROS environment is needed to be installed first. I confirmed that als_ros works on **Ubuntu 18.04** with melodic and **Ubuntu 20.04** with noetic.

als_ros can be installed with following commands.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/NaokiAkai/als_ros.git
$ cd als_ros
$ catkin_make
$ source devel/setup.bash
```

If you do not want to make a new workspace for als_ros, please copy the als_ros package to your workspace. The cloned directory has a ROS workspace.



## How to use

Following messages (topics) are needed to be published; 

- sensor_msgs::LaserScan (/scan)
- nav_msgs::Odometry (/odom)
- nav_msgs::OccupancyGrid (/map)

Names inside of the brackets are default topic names.

Also, static transformation between following two frames is needed to be set.

- origin of a robot (base_link)
- 2D LiDAR (laser)

Names inside of the brackets are default frame names.

There are launch files in the als_ros package. These names can be changed in **mcl.launch**.



After setting the topics and transformation, the localization software can be used with mcl.launch.

```
$ roslaunch als_ros mcl.launch
```

In default, localization for pose tracking with the robust localization and reliability estimation techniques presented in [2, 3] is executed.



If you want to use fusion of pose tracking and global localization, please set use_gl_pose_sampler flag to true.

```
$ roslaunch als_ros mcl.launch use_gl_pose_sampler:=true
```

In als_ros, global localization is implemented using the free-space feature presented in [6].



If you want to use estimation of localization failure probability with misalignment recognition, please set use_mrf_failure_detector flag to true.

```
$ roslaunch als_ros mcl.launch use_mrf_failure_detector:=true
```



## Parameter descriptions

Descriptions for all the parameters are written in the launch files. I am planning to make a more precise document.
